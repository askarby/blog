I've not been the most active person, at least when it comes to my hobby projects - but I have a plan to fix it!

## The problem

My main problem is that I have no discipline, when it comes to hobbies. I know I should be working on my projects,
playing around with frameworks and languages, but I just don't do it. Usually I end up watching YouTube, or playing
games, or just doing nothing. I have a lot of ideas, but I never get around to actually doing them.

I also want to emphasize that I do other things like restoring my house, gardening and working out... but, I really
want to get back to my projects. Also, this shouldn't be a huge problem since I don't have kids - so a lack of time
is **not** the issue!

## ... and the solution

The solution to my problem consists of a few things, which consists of:

1. Make a plan!
2. Stick to the plan!
3. Success?

So, what's the plan, you might ask? Well, it's a balancing act, having to be ambitious enough to get things done, but
not be overly ambitious where I get to a point where I just "give up" and will be back to square one.

## Let's make a plan

The plan is to allocate (at least) 25 minutes every day, to work on my projects. If I feel like continuing, I'll take
another 25-minute period after a short break, and continue iterating up to four times before taking a longer break.
This is known as the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia].

## The pomodoro technique

A very quick introduction to the pomodoro technique is as follows (blatantly copy/pasted from [Wikipedia][wikipedia]):

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

After every completed task, record the outcome, to get a sense of accomplishment.

It's imperative to notice that every pomodoro cannot be divided up into subdivisions. If you get interrupted, you have to
either start over (on the pomodoro), or postpone the interruption (fix the in-law's printer, or whatever it might be)
until the pomodoro is completed.

For more in-depth information about the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia] consider visiting Francesco Cirillo's official [website][pomodoro].

## Applications

The original way of working with the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia] was to use a kitchen timer, pencil and a piece of timer. As an additional
piece of information, each period is called a pomodoro, since the original kitchen timer (used by Francesco Cirillo) was shaped like a tomato
(pomodoro means tomato in Italian).

If you feel like you need a more modern approach, various apps exists for that. I personally use the [Session][session] app, which is
by far the most polished Mac app (for the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia]) I've found (it also runs on iOS devices alike). If you're running
on Windows or another platform (different from Apple ecosystem), you might use an alternative native app (such as [Paymo Pomodoro Timer][paymo])
or use a web based solution.

Since I've only extensively used the [Session][session] app, I can only speak positively about that.

## Conclusion

I may succeed at becoming more productive, using the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia] - or I might not. I'm at least hoping to generate
a good set of behavioral patterns, which will help me in the future. Using the technique I'm hoping to be able to distance myself from
doing too little, and getting distracted by other things, when doing productive tasks.

The pattern of setting a timer, and adhering to the steps that the [pomodoro technique][wikipedia] dictates, will hopefully help me not
_only_ do that, but also stop me from going 2 hours straight into a task, feeling exhausted afterward (since I took no breaks). I'm hoping that
that the list of "done tasks" will help me feel more productive, and give me a sense of accomplishment.

Let's see how it goes!
