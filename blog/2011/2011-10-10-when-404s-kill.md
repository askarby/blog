This morning, when starting my JBoss AS 5.1, I was greated by the following message:

```
Failed to read schema document ‘http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd’, because
1) could not find the document;
2) the document could not be read;
3) the root element of the document is not <xsd:schema>.
```

Well, that sucked!

I havn’t come up with any workaround, sure switching to version 1.0 of the XSD does solve the problem, but introduces
a few new issues. Removing the XSD validation doesn’t make any difference what so ever.

Note to self, and Sun (well, now Oracle) – If you want to expose XSD or schemas in general (to the public) make sure
it’s available at all times.

**Open question:** does anyone know a workaround for this issues?
