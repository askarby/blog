Taking notes is one of those things where I think, there's no good way of doing this, is there?

Well, to be quite honest, the question is easy to ask but the answer is a bit more complicated than you'd immediately
expect. So let's dive "into the deep end" and contemplate about how we take notes, using various analog and digital
means of doing so.

As always, this is my opinion - yours may differ from mine (and that's perfectly fine ðŸ˜€).

## Types of notes

Notes are plentiful and varied by nature. If I have to come up with a few examples, this is what comes to mind:

- **Scribbling** When you start noting something meaningful, but it ends up with doodles and smiley faces
- **Sketches** You sketch something (for software development this can be diagrams, designs etc.)
- **TODO-lists** Your usual list of "this is what I'm going do today" (and you never get more than half-way through it)
- **Shopping lists** You know this one
- **Meeting notes** When you have to summarize what's been said, and the action items from a meeting
- ... there are more types, I'm sure ðŸ˜Š

Regardless of which type of notes we're talking about, they're prone to disappearing and not easily found when you need
them.

## Paper and Post-its

The first tool to know of, when it comes to taking notes, is the bare essentials - pen and paper! This tool will hardly
ever fail, it's cheap and widely available... it's guaranteed that your boss will never deny you from having access to this.

There's something about the tactile feeling of writing on paper, and when you make a mistake, you'll simply be able to
make a ball out of the sheet of paper and throw it in the bin. It's also a very nice way of discarding of tasks, if you
write a post-it, and as you complete task that - you bin it!

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, papers in loose form will quickly become an unorganized mess and where did you leave
that note... at your work desk?... and you're working from home today - GREAT ðŸ˜¡! I can't remember the number of times I've
written a post-it note, sticking it to my monitor, just to realize that I need it from another location.

The problem of loose papers are easily solved by writing notes in an actual notebook. You can go with a premium leather-bound
notebook, or a cheap china-produced version from "The dollar-store". Just don't forget to bring your notebook, when you change
the location you're working from.

Another tip, would be to date your notes. Just write a quick date at the corner of the page. It immensely helps me find what
I need, if I can connect it with a date.

Some people like to separate pages into common sections, if you like that kind of this, it's a great method for quickly
recognizing the contents of the notes. I read [this tweet](https://twitter.com/pfanderson/status/1428422482709602314) from Scott
Hanselman, that he likes to separate his notes into what's been said, and the action items. I like that a lot (for meeting notes,
that is).

## Tablets, Phones and Laptops

But we live in the modern era and technology can solve everything, right? I'm not sure if it's the one solution to everything,
but it can reduce the paper clutter a great deal. All you have to do is choose the correct piece on hardware and combine it
with the correct piece of software. That shouldn't be difficult, right?

Well, let's figure out what you actually need.

If your notes consist of small drawing, illustrations, diagrams or doodles - then you might want to go with a drawing tablet,
or a phone with a pen accessory. This does not mean that you can't make drawings with your mouse, trackpad or finger, but the
result is nowhere near what you'll accomplish with a pen.

Consider where you need your notes, are you often "on the go" - then availability will be very important, and you should ensure
that your note-taking device is portable.

I'm consciously not mentioning a desktop as a note-taking device, even though it is. If you're using a desktop, you'll very likely
end up with the same problem with papers and post-its, they're "stuck to the desk". That's not saying it has to be that way, multiple
note-taking tools (software based) will sync between devices, more on that in the next section.

## Software

Choosing the correct piece of software is essential, and I think I can come up with 3 quick rules that all needs to be covered, for
the note-taking software to be useful:

1. It needs to sync data between devices
2. It should meet your needs - if you only write textual notes, don't go for a drawing tablet!
3. It shouldn't be difficult to use - if it feels like it's "in your way", choose another piece of software.

Before jumping into specific pieces of software that I use (all of them, actually), I want to write a small disclaimer:

- My needs as a software developer may be drastically different from yours
- I'm on the Mac eco-system, which means that some software won't be available on Android nor PC platforms.
- You don't need specific software for note-taking, a flat text-file may be sufficient for your needs
- I only mentioned software I use, hence didn't leave out [OneNote][onenote], [Word][word] or other tools for note-taking  
  because they're bad - I just don't use them!

### Apple Notes

![apple notes](/assets/images/products/apple-notes.jpg)

My first mention of a software product is Apple's Notes application, even though I don't use it myself (all that often).

So why mention it, then? Well, when you buy any Apple Device (either being a MacBook, iPad or iPhone) you'll have access to the Notes
application. It doesn't require an Apple Pencil (when running on an iPad), but it greatly improves the experience.

The user interface it simple and intuitive, and allows you to do a wide range of note-taking, which includes both is not limited to:

- Taking notes, with text-input from the (on-screen) keyboard
- Making to-do lists (has a nice checkbox feature)
- Free-hand note-taking / sketching
- Shape recognition (if you draw a somewhat straight line, and don't release the Apple Pencil, it'll draw a
  pixel-perfect straight line for you!)
- Insertion of images
- Scanning of documents

A very nice feature with the Apple Notes application, is the tight-integration with the iPad. If you happen to have an Apple Pencil in
addition to an iPad, you'll be able to "swipe up" **with** the Apple Pencil on the lock-screen - that will take you directly with to
the Apple Notes application.

Apple Notes transparently syncs your notes between devices over iCloud. Writing a note on your iPhone will make it show up on your
MacBook and iPad and vice versa. You don't have to think about it (as long as iCloud has been configured on your device.

Since I don't use the application regularly I can't talk to the upsides, or downsides of it. It will however mention a few things. If
you're asking yourself which note-taking application is the best - the initial answer is really simple - it's whatever application is
available to you. Apple Notes should be able to cover 90% of common note-taking usages, all it requires is that you have an Apple device.
The best thing about it is that it's bundled with the MacOS, iPadOS and iOS operating systems... no need for an extra monetary investment.

Again, I don't use it regularly - which leads me to an Apple-only note-taking application that I **do** use regularly.

### Notability

![notability](/assets/images/products/notability.jpg)

[Notability][notability] is an Apple eco-system exclusive, that runs on a Mac, an iPadOS device as well as an iOS device.

It does everything that Apple Notes does for you, and adds a few useful features on top of that.

The first added feature I absolutely love is its shape recognition feature. It's similar to Apple Notes, but it makes your shapes editable.
After having drawn a line, you can select the end vertices and resize the line. After having drawn a rectangle you can freely move around its
vertices as well (retaining the rectangle shape). If you draw a square [Notability][notability] is intelligent enough to only let you scale
the square (and not let you deform it, to make it into a rectangle). A circle can have its radius (diameter) changed. Additional shapes are
also supported (triangles being one of them) - but I don't have an extensive list.

Another couple of really nice features are subtle usability enhancements that are progressively displayed as you draw:

- When drawing shapes, guides will appear to show if you're aligned with other shapes
- Moving shapes, free-text etc. around will add snapping behavior, which again making aligning content (even free-hand scribbling) easy
- After you've started creating a shape, if you add a second "pause" (not moving the pencil around) it'll bring up a small
  "magnifying glass"-like feature to ease alignment with other shapes even more

Where Apple Notes only synchronize over iCloud (even though it works really well), [Notability][notability] allows you to sync with even more
cloud providers. A few of these being [Dropbox][dropbox], [Google Drive][googledrive] and [OneDrive][onedrive] (just to mention a few).

To wrap up my points on [Notability][notability] I want to emphasize a few things. The differences between Apple Notes and [Notability][notability]
are not that far off anymore. The gap of features has minimized over the last couple of years, and your needs may be sufficiently met by Apple
Notes. Keep in mind that you have to pay a price for [Notability][notability] (around 10 USD), but for my requirements Ã­ts a small price to pay.

I guess it all comes down to one point, I'm a creature of habit, and it's very unlikely that I'll change any time soon.

### Joplin

![joplin](/assets/images/products/joplin.jpg)

[Joplin][joplin] is a free, fully Open Source note-taking application that differs immensely from Apple Notes and [Notability][notability]. Where
the previously mentioned apps are rooted in the paradigm of [WYSIWYG], [Joplin][joplin] is not!

[Joplin][joplin] is based on note-taking using the [Markdown][markdown] language, which makes it more focused on note-taking for software developers
(or at least tech-savvy people) than targeting a wide audience ([Joplin][joplin] is not for everyone!). It supports running on a wide range of
devices (and is **not** limited to the Apple eco-system). It will run on everything from Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS to Android.

I use [Joplin][joplin] for anything ranging from taking meeting notes, to making draft of blog posts. Anything where I have to make text-focused
notes, I use [Joplin][joplin].

Storage-integration with multiple cloud providers is made available for such providers as [Dropbox][dropbox] and [OneDrive][onedrive] (to mention a few),
what's even more interesting is that it has a [server implementation](https://hub.docker.com/r/joplin/server) that you can host on your own device.
Since the server implementation is made available through a docker image, you can host it on anything from a hosted docker solution to virtual
machines or even on a modern NAS (I know my QNAP NAS has that option at least). The server application currently doesn't do more than a cloud provider,
but plans are in the works to add realtime collaboration (live co-op editing) tools.

Another important feature that [Joplin][joplin] provides is that it doesn't try to do everything. To accommodate varying feature requirements it provides
a robust platform for taking notes in markdown, and then provides a versatile [plugin API](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/)
combined with a [plugin repository](https://github.com/joplin/plugins). This basically sets the "sky as the limit" for what [Joplin][joplin] can accomplish.

## Conclusion

This brings us to the end of this post, regarding my take on note-taking. Let's make one thing clear, I'm a software developer which means that I have
certain needs for note-taking. These may, or may not align with your needs.

A piece of paper and a post-it combined with a pencil or a pen is the absolute entry for taking notes. There's no need for an expensive investment in a tablet
if your needs are met with these basic tools. Maybe you can get by with taking permanent notes on your computer. I've found that I use multiple devices, and
I have a hard requirement for them to be synchronized and available regardless of where I am.

I would love to see someone with a different background than mine write a similar post, perhaps how you take notes as a project manager or a scrum master.
