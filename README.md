# Blog

This is a re-work of my blog, now implemented in Angular, using Scully.io.

## Checklist

This is the checklist of action items remaining, for the blog to function as expected

Completed items:
- [x] Initial setup of blog seems to work now.
- [x] Blog posts are visible (and rendered correctly)
- [x] Top-bar navigation is working
- [x] Side-bar navigation is working, albeit missing styling.

Still missing:
- [ ] Home (welcome) page
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Integration with front-matter on blog posts (missing header etc.)
- [ ] Setting up github actions for deploying blog
- [ ] Documentation of how the development environment is working
- [ ] Unit tests (jest)
- [ ] E2E tests (Cypress)
